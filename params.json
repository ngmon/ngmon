Schema-based structured monitoring data represent fundamental requirement for advanced real-time processing (e.g. pattern and causality detection) of huge amounts of such data.\r\n\r\nThis is extremely important especially in large-scale distributed infrastructure monitoring context. The goal of this project is to implement new functionality in respective daemon's components (event collector, access control component, long-term storage, publish/subscribe subsystem, communication protocol) in order to improve security and general usability.\r\n\r\n### Architecture\r\nimg\r\n\r\n### Who are we?\r\nngmon is currently developed as a part of research activities of  ([Lab of Software Architectures and Information Systems](lasaris.fi.muni.cz)), [Faculty of Informatics](fi.muni.cz) Masaryk University.","name":"Ngmon","google":"ngmon","tagline":"New Generation Monitoring Daemon"}
